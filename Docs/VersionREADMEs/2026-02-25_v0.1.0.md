# Investron v0.1.0 — Initial Release

**Date:** 2026-02-25

## Overview

First production release of Investron, a full-stack investing research platform. This release establishes the core application architecture — a FastAPI + PostgreSQL backend with a React + TypeScript frontend — and delivers watchlist management, stock detail views, real-time pricing, and in-app documentation.

## New Features

### Full-Stack Investing Research App (Phase 1a–1b)
- **Watchlist management** — add, remove, and view stock tickers with live price enrichment
- **Stock detail page** — key financial metrics (market cap, P/E, EPS, dividend yield, 52-week range, etc.) pulled from yfinance
- **Price history charts** — configurable period (1d–max) with Recharts visualization
- **Insider transactions** — recent insider buy/sell activity per ticker
- **SEC EDGAR integration** — rate-limited access to company filings

### In-App Documentation
- Docs page accessible from the application navigation
- Project overview, architecture description, and technology stack reference

### Deployment Infrastructure
- **Backend:** Railway deployment via `Procfile` (Uvicorn with configurable port)
- **Frontend:** Vercel deployment with Vite build pipeline

## Enhancements

### Concurrent Watchlist Price Fetching
- **Before:** Watchlist endpoint fetched prices sequentially — one ticker at a time, each waiting on the rate limiter. A 10-ticker watchlist could take 10+ seconds.
- **After:** Prices are fetched concurrently using `asyncio.gather()` with per-ticker timeouts (8 seconds). A 10-ticker watchlist now loads in ~2 seconds.
- **Files changed:** `backend/app/api/watchlist.py`

### yfinance Thread Pool Offloading
- **Problem:** yfinance uses synchronous HTTP calls internally (via `requests` / `curl_cffi`). Calling these directly from async handlers blocked the event loop, stalling all other requests.
- **Solution:** Extracted synchronous logic into `_get_stock_info_sync`, `_get_price_history_sync`, and `_get_insider_transactions_sync` helper functions. Async wrappers now use `loop.run_in_executor(None, ...)` to run them in the default thread pool.
- **Files changed:** `backend/app/services/yfinance_svc.py`

### Rate Limiter Tuning
- Increased yfinance rate limit from 1 request/second to 5 requests/2 seconds, enabling small bursts for concurrent watchlist fetches without hammering Yahoo Finance.
- **Files changed:** `backend/app/utils/rate_limiter.py`

### UI Layout
- Switched to full-width layout for the header and main content area, improving use of screen real estate.

## Bug Fixes

### yfinance Cloud Server Compatibility
yfinance requests were being blocked on cloud servers (Railway) due to bot detection. Fixed by:
1. Adding `curl_cffi` as a dependency to enable TLS fingerprint impersonation
2. Configuring yfinance to use a `curl_cffi` session with browser impersonation
3. Upgrading yfinance to a version with native `curl_cffi` support

**Commits:** `c02db8d`, `6fa0fee`, `d505d71`

### CORS Configuration Parsing
`CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable was not being split on commas, causing multi-origin configurations to fail. Fixed the parsing logic to correctly handle comma-separated values.

**Commit:** `40bb13d`

### Vercel Build Errors
TypeScript compilation errors prevented the frontend from deploying on Vercel. Resolved type issues to restore the build pipeline.
